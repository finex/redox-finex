* Customized keymap for Redox by Leonardo (FiNeX) Finetti
This keymap use the default one with some changes to suit my needs. Mainly
having most used symbols on a separated layer copying the common symbols from the
number keys to the second row, adding other symbols and ~◌̀~ ~◌́~ dead keys for
accents.


* Features and differences from default layout

- Added macro to print ~:-(~ and ~:-)~ strings.
- Added more arrows.
- Added ~(~ and ~)~ on Shifts keys (Space Cadet Shift).
- Tapdance:
  - ~;~ × 2 = ~:~
  - ~[~ × 2 = ~{~
  - ~]~ × 2 = ~}~
  - Double tap hold on ~DEL~ activate mouse layer
- Removed media layer

- Added missing "F11" and "F12" keys.
- Added ~Alt~, ~Ctrl~, ~Ctrl~ and ~Shift~ on home keys.

- Added clipboard and undo/redo keycodes.

* Layout
This keyboard layout is intended to be used with English (US, intl, with dead keys) settings on PC.

On GNU/Linux systems use the following command to set the keyboard layout:
#+begin_src sh
setxkbmap -layout us -variant intl -option eurosign:e
