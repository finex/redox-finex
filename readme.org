* Customized keymap for Redox by Leonardo (FiNeX) Finetti.
This keymap use the default one with some changes to suit my needs. Mainly
having most used symbol on a separated layer copying the common symbols from the
number keys to the second row, adding other symbols and ~◌̀~ ~◌́~ dead keys for
accents.


* Features
- Enabled USE_SERIAL for Falba.Tech Redox keyboards.
- Layouts: Colemak DHm, Qwerty.
- Added redundant ~Space~, ~Esc~, ~Ctrl~ and ~Enter~ keys. I like to have this keys on both halves.
- Added macro to print ~->~ and ~=>~ strings.
- Added macro to print ~:-(~ and ~:-)~ strings.
- Added more arrows.
- Added ~(~ and ~)~ on Shifts keys (Space Cadet Shift).
- Tapdance: ~:~ (~;~ × 2), ~{~ (~[~ × 2), ~}~ (~]~ × 2).
- Removed Mouse and media support.
- Added missing "Print Screen" and "Menu" keys.
- Added missing "F11" and "F12" keys.
- Added ~Alt~ modifier on home row.
- Added ~Ctrl~ modifier on home row.
- Added ~Ctrl~ modifier on home row.
- Added ~Shift other half~ on home keys: this allows to shift the right half pressing ~t~ on the left (or ~f~ using Qwerty), and the opposite pressing ~n~ (or ~j~ for Qwerty layout).


* Layout
This keyboard layout is intended to be used with English (US, intl, with dead keys) settings on PC.
