# Customized keymap for Redox by Leonardo (FiNeX) Finetti.

This keymap use the default one with some changes to suit my needs. Mainly
having most used symbol on a separated layer copying the common symbols on the
number keys on the second row and adding other symbols and `◌̀` `◌́` dead keys for
accents.

## Keys Legend

The following scheme describe the meaning of the keys symbols positions.

(\*): Shift is enabled with standard key or with custom home row shitfs which
enables left top corner keycode on thumbs keys to make it easier use the
keyboard whe one hand use the mouse.
